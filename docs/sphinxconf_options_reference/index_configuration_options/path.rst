path
~~~~

Index files path and file name (without extension). Mandatory.

Path specifies both directory and file name, but without extension.
``indexer`` will append different extensions to this path when
generating final names for both permanent and temporary index files.
Permanent data files have several different extensions starting with
‘.sp’; temporary files' extensions start with ‘.tmp’. It's safe to
remove ``.tmp*`` files is if indexer fails to remove them automatically.

For reference, different index files store the following data:

-  ``.spa`` stores document attributes (used in `extern
   docinfo <../../index_configuration_options/docinfo.md>`__ storage
   mode only);

-  ``.spd`` stores matching document ID lists for each word ID;

-  ``.sph`` stores index header information;

-  ``.spi`` stores word lists (word IDs and pointers to ``.spd`` file);

-  ``.spk`` stores kill-lists;

-  ``.spm`` stores MVA data;

-  ``.spp`` stores hit (aka posting, aka word occurrence) lists for each
   word ID;

-  ``.sps`` stores string attribute data.

-  ``.spe`` stores skip-lists to speed up doc-list filtering
