Supported systems
-----------------

Manticore can be compiled either from source or installed using prebuilt
packages. Most modern UNIX systems with a C++ compiler should be able to
compile and run Manticore without any modifications.

Currently known systems Manticore has been successfully running on are:

-  Linux 2.4.x, 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x (many various distributions)

-  Windows 7, 8, 10

-  FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x

-  NetBSD 1.6, 3.0

-  Solaris 9, 11

-  Mac OS X

CPU architectures known to work include i386 (aka x86), amd64 (aka
x86\_64), SPARC64, and ARM.

Chances are good that Manticore should work on other Unix platforms and/or
CPU architectures just as well. Please report any other platforms that
worked for you!

All platforms are production quality. There are no principal functional
limitations on any platform.
