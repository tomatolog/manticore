snippets\_file\_prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A prefix to prepend to the local file names when generating snippets.
Optional, default is empty.

This prefix can be used in distributed snippets generation along with
``load_files`` or ``load_files_scattered`` options.

Note how this is a prefix, and <b>not</b> a path! Meaning that if a
prefix is set to “server1” and the request refers to “file23”,
``searchd`` will attempt to open “server1file23” (all of that without
quotes). So if you need it to be a path, you have to mention the
trailing slash.

Note also that this is a local option, it does not affect the agents
anyhow. So you can safely set a prefix on a master server. The requests
routed to the agents will not be affected by the master's setting. They
will however be affected by the agent's own settings.

This might be useful, for instance, when the document storage locations
(be those local storage or NAS mountpoints) are inconsistent across the
servers.
