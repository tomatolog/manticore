regexp\_filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regular expressions (regexps) to filter the fields and queries with.
Optional, multi-value, default is an empty list of regexps.

In certain applications (like product search) there can be many
different ways to call a model, or a product, or a property, and so on.
For instance, ‘iphone 3gs’ and ‘iphone 3 gs’ (or even ‘iphone3 gs’) are
very likely to mean the same product. Or, for a more tricky example,
‘13-inch’, ‘13 inch’, '13“‘, and '13in’ in a laptop screen size
descriptions do mean the same.

Regexps provide you with a mechanism to specify a number of rules
specific to your application to handle such cases. In the first ‘iphone
3gs’ example, you could possibly get away with a wordforms files
tailored to handle a handful of iPhone models. However even in a
comparatively simple second ‘13-inch’ example there is just way too many
individual forms and you are better off specifying rules that would
normalize both ‘13-inch’ and ‘13in’ to something identical.

Regular expressions listed in ``regexp_filter`` are applied in the order
they are listed. That happens at the earliest stage possible, before any
other processing, even before tokenization. That is, regexps are applied
to the raw source fields when indexing, and to the raw search query text
when searching.

We use the `RE2 engine <https://github.com/google/re2>`__ to implement
regexps. So when building from the source, the library must be installed
in the system and Sphinx must be configured built with a ``--with-re2``
switch. Binary packages should come with RE2 builtin.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

::


    # index '13-inch' as '13inch'
    regexp_filter = \b(\d+)\" => \1inch

    # index 'blue' or 'red' as 'color'
    regexp_filter = (blue|red) => color
