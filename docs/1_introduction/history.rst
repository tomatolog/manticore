History
-------

Manticore development was started back in 2001, because I didn't manage to
find an acceptable search solution (for a database driven Web site)
which would meet my requirements. Actually, each and every important
aspect was a problem:

-  search quality (ie. good relevance)

   -  statistical ranking methods performed rather bad, especially on
      large collections of small documents (forums, blogs, etc)

-  search speed

   -  especially if searching for phrases which contain stopwords, as in
      “to be or not to be”

-  moderate disk and CPU requirements when indexing

   -  important in shared hosting environment, not to mention the
      indexing speed.

Despite the amount of time passed and numerous improvements made in the
other solutions, there's still no solution which I personally would be
eager to migrate to.

Considering that and a lot of positive feedback received from Manticore
users during last years, the obvious decision is to continue developing
Manticore (and, eventually, to take over the world).
