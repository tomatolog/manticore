Chapter 4. Real-time indexes
============================

Real-time indexes (or RT indexes for brevity) are a backend that lets
you insert, update, or delete documents (rows) on the fly. While
querying of RT indexes is possible using any of the ManticoreAPI, ManticoreQL,
or ManticoreSE, updating them is only possible via ManticoreQL at the moment.
Full ManticoreQL reference is available in `Chapter 8, *ManticoreQL
reference* <../8_sphinxql_reference/README.md>`__.
