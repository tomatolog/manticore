BuildExcerpts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<b>Prototype:</b> function BuildExcerpts ( $docs, $index, $words,
$opts=array() )

Excerpts (snippets) builder function. Connects to ``searchd``, asks it
to generate excerpts (snippets) from given documents, and returns the
results.

``$docs`` is a plain array of strings that carry the documents'
contents. ``$index`` is an index name string. Different settings (such
as charset, morphology, wordforms) from given index will be used.
``$words`` is a string that contains the keywords to highlight. They
will be processed with respect to index settings. For instance, if
English stemming is enabled in the index, “shoes” will be highlighted
even if keyword is “shoe”. Keywords can contain wildcards, that work
similarly to star-syntax available in queries. ``$opts`` is a hash which
contains additional optional highlighting parameters:

-  “before\_match”:
-  A string to insert before a keyword match. A %PASSAGE\_ID% macro can
   be used in this string. The first match of the macro is replaced with
   an incrementing passage number within a current snippet. Numbering
   starts at 1 by default but can be overridden with
   “start\_passage\_id” option. In a multi-document call, %PASSAGE\_ID%
   would restart at every given document. Default is “<b>”.

-  “after\_match”:
-  A string to insert after a keyword match. Starting with version
   1.10-beta, a %PASSAGE\_ID% macro can be used in this string. Default
   is “</b>”.

-  “chunk\_separator”:
-  A string to insert between snippet chunks (passages). Default is " …
   “.

-  “limit”:
-  Maximum snippet size, in symbols (codepoints). Integer, default is
   256.

-  “around”:
-  How much words to pick around each matching keywords block. Integer,
   default is 5.

-  “exact\_phrase”:
-  Whether to highlight exact query phrase matches only instead of
   individual keywords. Boolean, default is false.

-  “use\_boundaries”:
-  Whether to additionally break passages by phrase boundary characters,
   as configured in index settings with
   `phrase\_boundary <../../index_configuration_options/phraseboundary.md>`__
   directive. Boolean, default is false.

-  “weight\_order”:
-  Whether to sort the extracted passages in order of relevance
   (decreasing weight), or in order of appearance in the document
   (increasing position). Boolean, default is false.

-  “query\_mode”:
-  Whether to handle $words as a query in `extended
   syntax <../../extended_query_syntax.md>`__, or as a bag of words
   (default behavior). For instance, in query mode (“one two” \| “three
   four”) will only highlight and include those occurrences “one two” or
   “three four” when the two words from each pair are adjacent to each
   other. In default mode, any single occurrence of “one”, “two”,
   “three”, or “four” would be highlighted. Boolean, default is false.

-  “force\_all\_words”:
-  Ignores the snippet length limit until it includes all the keywords.
   Boolean, default is false.

-  “limit\_passages”:
-  Limits the maximum number of passages that can be included into the
   snippet. Integer, default is 0 (no limit).

-  “limit\_words”:
-  Limits the maximum number of words that can be included into the
   snippet. Note the limit applies to any words, and not just the
   matched keywords to highlight. For example, if we are highlighting
   “Mary” and a passage “Mary had a little lamb” is selected, then it
   contributes 5 words to this limit, not just 1. Integer, default is 0
   (no limit).

-  “start\_passage\_id”:
-  Specifies the starting value of %PASSAGE\_ID% macro (that gets
   detected and expanded in ``before_match``, ``after_match`` strings).
   Integer, default is 1.

-  “load\_files”:
-  Whether to handle $docs as data to extract snippets from (default
   behavior), or to treat it as file names, and load data from specified
   files on the server side. Up to
   `dist\_threads <../../searchd_program_configuration_options/distthreads.md>`__
   worker threads per request will be created to parallelize the work
   when this flag is enabled. Boolean, default is false. Building of the
   snippets could be parallelized between remote agents. Just set the
   `‘dist\_threads’ <../../searchd_program_configuration_options/distthreads.md>`__
   param in the config to the value greater than 1, and then invoke the
   snippets generation over the distributed index, which contain only
   one(!) `local <../../index_configuration_options/local.md>`__ agent
   and several remotes. The
   `snippets\_file\_prefix <../../searchd_program_configuration_options/snippetsfile_prefix.md>`__
   option is also in the game and the final filename is calculated by
   concatenation of the prefix with given name. Otherwords, when
   snippets\_file\_prefix is ‘/var/data’ and filename is ‘text.txt’ the
   sphinx will try to generate the snippets from the file
   ‘/var/datatext.txt’, which is exactly ‘/var/data’ + ‘text.txt’.

-  “load\_files\_scattered”:
-  It works only with distributed snippets generation with remote
   agents. The source files for snippets could be distributed among
   different agents, and the main daemon will merge together all
   non-erroneous results. So, if one agent of the distributed index has
   ‘file1.txt’, another has ‘file2.txt’ and you call for the snippets
   with both these files, the sphinx will merge results from the agents
   together, so you will get the snippets from both ‘file1.txt’ and
   ‘file2.txt’. Boolean, default is false.

   If the “load\_files” is also set, the request will return the error
   in case if any of the files is not available anywhere. Otherwise (if
   “load\_files” is not set) it will just return the empty strings for
   all absent files. The master instance reset this flag when
   distributes the snippets among agents. So, for agents the absence of
   a file is not critical error, but for the master it might be so. If
   you want to be sure that all snippets are actually created, set both
   “load\_files\_scattered” and “load\_files”. If the absence of some
   snippets caused by some agents is not critical for you - set just
   “load\_files\_scattered”, leaving “load\_files” not set.

-  “html\_strip\_mode”:
-  HTML stripping mode setting. Defaults to “index”, which means that
   index settings will be used. The other values are “none” and “strip”,
   that forcibly skip or apply stripping irregardless of index settings;
   and “retain”, that retains HTML markup and protects it from
   highlighting. The “retain” mode can only be used when highlighting
   full documents and thus requires that no snippet size limits are set.
   String, allowed values are “none”, “strip”, “index”, and “retain”.

-  “allow\_empty”:
-  Allows empty string to be returned as highlighting result when a
   snippet could not be generated (no keywords match, or no passages fit
   the limit). By default, the beginning of original text would be
   returned instead of an empty string. Boolean, default is false.

-  “passage\_boundary”:
-  Ensures that passages do not cross a sentence, paragraph, or zone
   boundary (when used with an index that has the respective indexing
   settings enabled). String, allowed values are “sentence”,
   “paragraph”, and “zone”.

-  “emit\_zones”:
-  Emits an HTML tag with an enclosing zone name before each passage.
   Boolean, default is false.

Snippets extraction algorithm currently favors better passages (with
closer phrase matches), and then passages with keywords not yet in
snippet. Generally, it will try to highlight the best match with the
query, and it will also to highlight all the query keywords, as made
possible by the limits. In case the document does not match the query,
beginning of the document trimmed down according to the limits will be
return by default. You can also return an empty snippet instead case by
setting “allow\_empty” option to true.

Returns false on failure. Returns a plain array of strings with excerpts
(snippets) on success.
