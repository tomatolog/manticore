Chapter 4. Real-time indexes
============================

Real-time indexes (or RT indexes for brevity) are a backend that lets
you insert, update, or delete documents (rows) on the fly. While
querying of RT indexes is possible using any of the SphinxAPI, SphinxQL,
or ManticoreSE, updating them is only possible via SphinxQL at the moment.
Full SphinxQL reference is available in `Chapter 8, *SphinxQL
reference* <../8_sphinxql_reference/README.md>`__.
