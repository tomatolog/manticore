agent\_retry\_count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, specifies how many times sphinx will try to connect and query
remote agents in distributed index before reporting fatal query error.
Default is 0 (i.e. no retries). This value may be also specified on
per-query basis using ‘OPTION retry\_count=XXX’ clause. If per-query
option exists, it will override the one specified in config.

Note, that if you use `agent
mirrors <../../index_configuration_options/agent.md>`__ in definition of
your distributed index, then before every attempt of connect sphinx will
select different mirror, according to specified
`ha\_strategy <../../index_configuration_options/hastrategy.md>`__\ specified.

For example, if you have 10 mirrors, and surely know, that at least one
of them alive, then you can definitely take the answer to a correct
query, specifying options ``ha_strategy = roundrobin`` and
``agent_retry_count = 9`` in your config.
