DELETE syntax
-------------

::


    DELETE FROM index WHERE where_condition

DELETE statement is only supported for RT indexes and for distributed
which contains only RT indexes as agents It deletes existing rows
(documents) from an existing index based on ID.

``index`` is the name of RT index from which the row should be deleted.

``where_condition`` has the same syntax as in the SELECT statement (see
`the section called “SELECT syntax” <../select_syntax.md>`__ for
details).
