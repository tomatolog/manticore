RT indexes overview
-------------------

RT indexes should be declared in ``sphinx.conf``, just as every other
index type. Notable differences from the regular, disk-based indexes are
that a) data sources are not required and ignored, and b) you should
explicitly enumerate all the text fields, not just attributes. Here's an
example:

Example 4.1. RT index declaration
                                 

::


    index rt
    {
        type = rt
        path = /usr/local/sphinx/data/rt
        rt_field = title
        rt_field = content
        rt_attr_uint = gid
    }

RT index can be accessed using MySQL protocol. INSERT, REPLACE, DELETE,
and SELECT statements against RT index are supported. For instance, this
is an example session with the sample index above:

::


    $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 9306
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1
    Server version: 1.10-dev (r2153)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

    mysql> INSERT INTO rt VALUES ( 1, 'first record', 'test one', 123 );
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)

    mysql> INSERT INTO rt VALUES ( 2, 'second record', 'test two', 234 );
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt;
    +------+--------+------+
    | id   | weight | gid  |
    +------+--------+------+
    |    1 |      1 |  123 |
    |    2 |      1 |  234 |
    +------+--------+------+
    2 rows in set (0.02 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt WHERE MATCH('test');
    +------+--------+------+
    | id   | weight | gid  |
    +------+--------+------+
    |    1 |   1643 |  123 |
    |    2 |   1643 |  234 |
    +------+--------+------+
    2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt WHERE MATCH('@title test');
    Empty set (0.00 sec)

Both partial and batch INSERT syntaxes are supported, ie. you can
specify a subset of columns, and insert several rows at a time.
Deletions are also possible using DELETE statement; the only currently
supported syntax is DELETE FROM <index> WHERE id=<id>. REPLACE is also
supported, enabling you to implement updates.

::


    mysql> INSERT INTO rt ( id, title ) VALUES ( 3, 'third row' ), ( 4, 'fourth entry' );
    Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt;
    +------+--------+------+
    | id   | weight | gid  |
    +------+--------+------+
    |    1 |      1 |  123 |
    |    2 |      1 |  234 |
    |    3 |      1 |    0 |
    |    4 |      1 |    0 |
    +------+--------+------+
    4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> DELETE FROM rt WHERE id=2;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt WHERE MATCH('test');
    +------+--------+------+
    | id   | weight | gid  |
    +------+--------+------+
    |    1 |   1500 |  123 |
    +------+--------+------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> INSERT INTO rt VALUES ( 1, 'first record on steroids', 'test one', 123 );
    ERROR 1064 (42000): duplicate id '1'

    mysql> REPLACE INTO rt VALUES ( 1, 'first record on steroids', 'test one', 123 );
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> SELECT * FROM rt WHERE MATCH('steroids');
    +------+--------+------+
    | id   | weight | gid  |
    +------+--------+------+
    |    1 |   1500 |  123 |
    +------+--------+------+
    1 row in set (0.01 sec)

Data stored in RT index should survive clean shutdown. When binary
logging is enabled, it should also survive crash and/or dirty shutdown,
and recover on subsequent startup.
