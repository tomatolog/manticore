Required tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On UNIX, you will need the following tools to build and install Manticore:

-  a working C++ compiler. GNU gcc and clang are known to work.

-  a good make program. GNU make is known to work.

On Windows, you will need Microsoft Visual C/C++ Studio 2013 or above.
Other compilers/environments will probably work as well, but for the
time being, you will have to build makefile (or other environment
specific project files) manually.
