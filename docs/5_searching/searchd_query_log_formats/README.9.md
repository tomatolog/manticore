## `searchd` query log formats {#searchd-query-log-formats}

In version 2.0.1-beta and above two query log formats are supported. Previous versions only supported a custom plain text format. That format is still the default one. However, while it might be more convenient for manual monitoring and review, but hard to replay for benchmarks, it only logs _search_ queries but not the other types of requests, does not always contain the complete search query data, etc. The default text format is also harder (and sometimes impossible) to replay for benchmarking purposes. The new `sphinxql` format alleviates that. It aims to be complete and automatable, even though at the cost of brevity and readability.
