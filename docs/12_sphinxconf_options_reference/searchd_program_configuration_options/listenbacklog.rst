listen\_backlog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCP listen backlog. Optional, default is 5.

Windows builds currently can only process the requests one by one.
Concurrent requests will be enqueued by the TCP stack on OS level, and
requests that can not be enqueued will immediately fail with “connection
refused” message. listen\_backlog directive controls the length of the
connection queue. Non-Windows builds should work fine with the default
value.

Example:

::


    listen_backlog = 20
