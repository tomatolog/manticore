Comment syntax
--------------

ManticoreQL supports C-style comment syntax. Everything from an opening
``/*`` sequence to a closing ``*/`` sequence is ignored. Comments can
span multiple lines, can not nest, and should not get logged. MySQL
specific ``/*! ... */`` comments are also currently ignored. (As the
comments support was rather added for better compatibility with
``mysqldump`` produced dumps, rather than improving general query
interoperability between Manticore and MySQL.)
