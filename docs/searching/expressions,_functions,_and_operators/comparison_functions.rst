Comparison functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  IF()
-  ``IF()`` behavior is slightly different that that of its MySQL
   counterpart. It takes 3 arguments, check whether the 1st argument is
   equal to 0.0, returns the 2nd argument if it is not zero, or the 3rd
   one when it is. Note that unlike comparison operators, ``IF()`` does
   <b>not</b> use a threshold! Therefore, it's safe to use comparison
   results as its 1st argument, but arithmetic operators might produce
   unexpected results. For instance, the following two calls will
   produce *different* results even though they are logically
   equivalent:

   ::


       IF ( sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)-3<>0, a, b )
       IF ( sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)-3, a, b )

   In the first case, the comparison operator <> will return 0.0 (false)
   because of a threshold, and ``IF()`` will always return ‘b’ as a
   result. In the second one, the same ``sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)-3`` expression
   will be compared with zero *without* threshold by the ``IF()``
   function itself. But its value will be slightly different from zero
   because of limited floating point calculations precision. Because of
   that, the comparison with 0.0 done by ``IF()`` will not pass, and the
   second variant will return ‘a’ as a result.

-  IN()
-  IN(expr,val1,val2,…) takes 2 or more arguments, and returns 1 if 1st
   argument (expr) is equal to any of the other arguments (val1..valN),
   or 0 otherwise. Currently, all the checked values (but not the
   expression itself!) are required to be constant. (Its technically
   possible to implement arbitrary expressions too, and that might be
   implemented in the future.) Constants are pre-sorted and then binary
   search is used, so IN() even against a big arbitrary list of
   constants will be very quick. First argument can also be a MVA
   attribute. In that case, IN() will return 1 if any of the MVA values
   is equal to any of the other arguments. IN() also supports
   ``IN(expr,@uservar)`` syntax to check whether the value belongs to
   the list in the given global user variable. First argument can be
   JSON attribute.

-  INTERVAL()
-  INTERVAL(expr,point1,point2,point3,…), takes 2 or more arguments, and
   returns the index of the argument that is less than the first
   argument: it returns 0 if expr<point1, 1 if point1<=expr<point2, and
   so on. It is required that point1<point2<…<pointN for this function
   to work correctly.
