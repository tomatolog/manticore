SHOW CHARACTER SET syntax
-------------------------

::


    SHOW CHARACTER SET

This is currently a placeholder query that does nothing and reports that
a UTF-8 character set is available. It was added in order to keep
compatibility with frameworks and connectors that automatically execute
this statement.

    mysql> SHOW CHARACTER SET;
