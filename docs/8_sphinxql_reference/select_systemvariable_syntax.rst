SELECT @@system\_variable syntax
--------------------------------

::


    SELECT @@system_variable [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]

This is currently a placeholder query that does nothing and reports
success. That is in order to keep compatibility with frameworks and
connectors that automatically execute this statement.
