max\_file\_field\_buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum file field adaptive buffer size, bytes. Optional, default is 8
MB, minimum is 1 MB.

File field buffer is used to load files referred to from
`sql\_file\_field <../../data_source_configuration_options/sqlfile_field.md>`__
columns. This buffer is adaptive, starting at 1 MB at first allocation,
and growing in 2x steps until either file contents can be loaded, or
maximum buffer size, specified by ``max_file_field_buffer`` directive,
is reached.

Thus, if there are no file fields are specified, no buffer is allocated
at all. If all files loaded during indexing are under (for example) 2 MB
in size, but ``max_file_field_buffer`` value is 128 MB, peak buffer
usage would still be only 2 MB. However, files over 128 MB would be
entirely skipped.
