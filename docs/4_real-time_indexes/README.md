# Chapter 4. Real-time indexes {#chapter-4-real-time-indexes}

Real-time indexes (or RT indexes for brevity) are a new backend that lets you insert, update, or delete documents (rows) on the fly. RT indexes were added in version 1.10-beta. While querying of RT indexes is possible using any of the SphinxAPI, SphinxQL, or SphinxSE, updating them is only possible via SphinxQL at the moment. Full SphinxQL reference is available in [Chapter 8, _SphinxQL reference_](../8_sphinxql_reference/README.md).
