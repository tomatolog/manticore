## History {#history}

Sphinx development was started back in 2001, because I didn&#039;t manage to find an acceptable search solution (for a database driven Web site) which would meet my requirements. Actually, each and every important aspect was a problem:

*   search quality (ie. good relevance)

    *   statistical ranking methods performed rather bad, especially on large collections of small documents (forums, blogs, etc)

*   search speed

    *   especially if searching for phrases which contain stopwords, as in &quot;to be or not to be&quot;

*   moderate disk and CPU requirements when indexing

    *   important in shared hosting environment, not to mention the indexing speed.

Despite the amount of time passed and numerous improvements made in the other solutions, there&#039;s still no solution which I personally would be eager to migrate to.

Considering that and a lot of positive feedback received from Sphinx users during last years, the obvious decision is to continue developing Sphinx (and, eventually, to take over the world).
