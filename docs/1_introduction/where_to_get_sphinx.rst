Where to get Sphinx
-------------------

Sphinx is available through its official Web site at
http://sphinxsearch.com/.

Currently, Sphinx distribution tarball includes the following software:

-  ``indexer``: an utility which creates fulltext indexes;

-  ``searchd``: a daemon which enables external software (eg. Web
   applications) to search through fulltext indexes;

-  ``sphinxapi``: a set of searchd client API libraries for popular Web
   scripting languages (PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby).

-  ``spelldump``: a simple command-line tool to extract the items from
   an ``ispell`` or ``MySpell`` (as bundled with OpenOffice) format
   dictionary to help customize your index, for use with
   `wordforms <../index_configuration_options/wordforms.rst>`__.

-  ``indextool``: an utility to dump miscellaneous debug information
   about the index, added in version 0.9.9-rc2.

-  ``wordbreaker``: an utility to break down compound words into
   separate words, added in version 2.1.1.
