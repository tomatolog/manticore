SHOW PLUGINS syntax
-------------------

::


    SHOW PLUGINS

Displays all the loaded plugins and UDFs. “Type” column should be one of
the udf, ranker, index\_token\_filter, or query\_token\_filter. “Users”
column is the number of thread that are currently using that plugin in a
query. “Extra” column is intended for various additional plugin-type
specific information; currently, it shows the return type for the UDFs
and is empty for all the other plugin types.
