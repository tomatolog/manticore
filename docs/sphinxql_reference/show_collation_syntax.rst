SHOW COLLATION syntax
---------------------

::


    SHOW COLLATION

This is currently a placeholder query that does nothing and reports
success. That is in order to keep compatibility with frameworks and
connectors that automatically execute this statement.

::


    mysql> SHOW COLLATION;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
