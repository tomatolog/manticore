Installing Sphinx on Windows
----------------------------

Installing Sphinx on a Windows server is often easier than installing on
a Linux environment; unless you are preparing code patches, you can use
the pre-compiled binary files from the Downloads area on the website.

1. Extract everything from the .zip file you have downloaded -
   ``sphinx-2.3.2-beta-win32.zip``, or
   ``sphinx-2.3.2-beta-win32-pgsql.zip`` if you need PostgresSQL support
   as well. (We are using version 2.3.2-beta here for the sake of
   example only; be sure to change this to a specific version you're
   using.) You can use Windows Explorer in Windows XP and up to extract
   the files, or a freeware package like 7Zip to open the archive.

   For the remainder of this guide, we will assume that the folders are
   unzipped into ``C:\Sphinx``, such that ``searchd.exe`` can be found
   in ``C:\Sphinx\bin\searchd.exe``. If you decide to use any different
   location for the folders or configuration file, please change it
   accordingly.

2. Edit the contents of sphinx.conf.in - specifically entries relating
   to @CONFDIR@ - to paths suitable for your system.

3. Install the ``searchd`` system as a Windows service:

   **``C:\Sphinx\bin&gt; C:\Sphinx\bin\searchd --install --config C:\Sphinx\sphinx.conf.in --servicename SphinxSearch``**

4. The ``searchd`` service will now be listed in the Services panel
   within the Management Console, available from Administrative Tools.
   It will not have been started, as you will need to configure it and
   build your indexes with ``indexer`` before starting the service. A
   guide to do this can be found under `Quick
   tour <../quick_sphinx_usage_tour.md>`__.

   During the next steps of the install (which involve running indexer
   pretty much as you would on Linux) you may find that you get an error
   relating to libmysql.dll not being found. If you have MySQL
   installed, you should find a copy of this library in your Windows
   directory, or sometimes in Windows:raw-latex:`\System`32, or failing
   that in the MySQL core directories. If you do receive an error please
   copy libmysql.dll into the bin directory.
