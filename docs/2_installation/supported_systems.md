## Supported systems {#supported-systems}

Sphinx can be compiled either from source or installed using prebuilt packages. Most modern UNIX systems with a C++ compiler should be able to compile and run Sphinx without any modifications.

Currently known systems Sphinx has been successfully running on are:

*   Linux 2.4.x, 2.6.x, 3.x (many various distributions)

*   Windows 2000, XP, 7, 8

*   FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x

*   NetBSD 1.6, 3.0

*   Solaris 9, 11

*   Mac OS X

CPU architectures known to work include i386 (aka x86), amd64 (aka x86_64), SPARC64, and ARM.

Chances are good that Sphinx should work on other Unix platforms and/or CPU architectures just as well. Please report any other platforms that worked for you!

All platforms are production quality. There are no principal functional limitations on any platform.
