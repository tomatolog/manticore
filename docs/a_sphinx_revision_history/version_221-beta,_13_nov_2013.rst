Optimizations, behavior changes, and removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  optimized JSON attributes access (1.12x to 2.0x+ total query speedup
   depending on the JSON data)
-  optimized SELECT (1.02x to 3.5x speedup, depending on index schema
   size)
-  optimized `UPDATE <../update_syntax.md>`__ (up to 3x faster on big
   updates)
-  optimized away internal threads table mutex contention with
   ``workers=threads`` and 1000s of threads
-  changed [emptyword -foo] query behavior in cases when emptyword is a
   stopword or an overshort word, made such queries computable rather
   than erroneous
-  changed post-morphology
   `wordforms <../index_configuration_options/wordforms.md>`__ behavior,
   now it works as
   ``&#039;if ( stem(token)==stem(abc) ) emit(def)&#039;``
-  changed the `config
   defaults <../sphinx_deprecations_and_changes_in_default_configu.md>`__
   to ``id64``, ``dict=keywords``, ``charset_type=utf-8``,
   ``enable_star=1``, ``workers=threads``, ``mem_limit=128M``,
   ``rt_mem_limit=128M``
-  changed the default ManticoreAPI matching mode to
   `SPH\_MATCH\_EXTENDED2 <../matching_modes.md>`__
-  disallowed dashes in index names in API requests (just like in
   SphinxQL)
-  removed legacy ``xmlpipe`` data source v1, ``compat_sphinxql_magics``
   directive, ``SetWeights()`` ManticoreAPI call, and SPH\_SORT\_CUSTOM
   ManticoreAPI mode

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  fixed #1734, unquoted literal in json subscript could cause a crash,
   returns ‘unknown column’ now.
-  fixed #1683, under certain conditions
   `stopwords <../index_configuration_options/stopwords.md>`__ were not
   taken into account in RT indexes
-  fixed #1648, #1644, when using AOT lemmas with snippet generation,
   not all the forms got highlighted
-  fixed #1549,
   `OPTION <../select_syntax.md>`__\ ``idf=tfidf_normalized`` was
   ignored for distributed queries
-  fixed that `ORDER BY RAND() <../select_syntax.md>`__ was not affected
   by ``index_weights``
-  fixed that float updates with integer values in SphinxQL mistakenly
   set the float to 0
-  fixed that ``predicted_time`` was not accumulated with
   `dist\_threads <../searchd_program_configuration_options/distthreads.md>`__
-  fixed `GROUP\_CONCAT <../select_syntax.md>`__ result length limit
   (was implicitly limited by 1024 bytes)
-  fixed agent query distribution in HA mirroring
-  fixed duplicates check for `quorum
   operator <../extended_query_syntax.md>`__, it works ok now for
   expanded keywords
-  fixed off-by-1 query positions of words in indexes with wordforms and
   `blended characters <../extended_query_syntax.md>`__
-  fixed wrong ``lcs`` and
   `min\_best\_span\_pos <../search_results_ranking/field-level_ranking_factors.md>`__
   ranking factor values when any expansion
   (`expand\_keywords <../index_configuration_options/expandkeywords.md>`__
   or lemmatize) occurred
-  fixed a crash while creating indexes with
   `sql\_joined\_field <../data_source_configuration_options/sqljoined_field.md>`__
