sql\_query\_pre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-fetch query, or pre-query. Multi-value, optional, default is empty
list of queries. Applies to SQL source types (``mysql``, ``pgsql``,
``mssql``) only.

Multi-value means that you can specify several pre-queries. They are
executed before `the main fetch
query <../../data_source_configuration_options/sqlquery.md>`__, and they
will be executed exactly in order of appearance in the configuration
file. Pre-query results are ignored.

Pre-queries are useful in a lot of ways. They are used to setup
encoding, mark records that are going to be indexed, update internal
counters, set various per-connection SQL server options and variables,
and so on.

Perhaps the most frequent pre-query usage is to specify the encoding
that the server will use for the rows it returns. Note that Manticore
accepts only UTF-8 texts. Two MySQL specific examples of setting the
encoding are:

::


    sql_query_pre = SET CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=utf8
    sql_query_pre = SET NAMES utf8

Also specific to MySQL sources, it is useful to disable query cache (for
indexer connection only) in pre-query, because indexing queries are not
going to be re-run frequently anyway, and there's no sense in caching
their results. That could be achieved with:

::


    sql_query_pre = SET SESSION query_cache_type=OFF

Example:
^^^^^^^^

::


    sql_query_pre = SET NAMES utf8
    sql_query_pre = SET SESSION query_cache_type=OFF
