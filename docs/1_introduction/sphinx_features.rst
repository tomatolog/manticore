Manticore features
---------------

Key Manticore features are:

-  high indexing and searching performance;

-  advanced indexing and querying tools (flexible and feature-rich text
   tokenizer, querying language, several different ranking modes, etc);

-  advanced result set post-processing (SELECT with expressions, WHERE,
   ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING etc over text search results);

   1,000,000 documents, 1.2 GB of data on an internal benchmark);

-  has high scalability (biggest known cluster indexes over
   3,000,000,000 documents, and busiest one peaks over 50,000,000
   queries/day);

-  provides good relevance ranking through combination of phrase
   proximity ranking and statistical (BM25) ranking;

-  provides distributed searching capabilities;

-  provides document excerpts (snippets) generation;

-  provides searching from within application with SphinxQL or SphinxAPI
   interfaces, and from within MySQL with pluggable ManticoreSE storage
   engine;
